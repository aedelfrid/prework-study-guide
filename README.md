# prework-study-guide

## Description

The prework-study-guide was created out of the necessity to learn new, filter, and store information about coding.

The issue at hand is the sheer amount of information being thrown at me in even the week before class starts. 
If the whole bootcamp is this intensive, give-or-take, then it behooves me to have a place to make notes and practice my skills.
Over the course of this project I have learned the very basics of the Github workflow, HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

## Installation

This project is to be hosted via the Github pages tool and therefore may be accessed via it's URL; https://aedelfrid.github.io/prework-study-guide/

## Usage

This project can be used by accessing it's [URL](https://aedelfrid.github.io/prework-study-guide/). Most Information would be displayed as its presented. However to show the Javascript
functions, one must open the console. 

If on Windows you may hit the F12 button on the keyboard or right click and select the "inspect"
function at the bottom of the right-click menu.

## Credits

I'd like to thank my mom and my da- 

Ahem- sorry, I mostly worked on this myself with - let's face it - all of the code coming from the bootcamp website so credit to them and also to Mozilla webdocs here 
https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/Getting_started_with_the_web/JavaScript_basics#conclusion

Another chunk of code was borrowed from W3Schools, notably from this page: https://www.w3schools.com/howto/howto_js_topnav_responsive.asp
